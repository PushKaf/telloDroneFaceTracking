# What Does It Do?
Well, as the name implies, it just tracks your face.

Uses opencv to track your face and djitellopy to control the drone.

Had a drone laying around, so why wot; i had fun!

# Can I Use This?
Sure! Go for it, but you'll need all the modules, which i havent provided because i forgot to do this in an environment,
and did all the tello projects in the same env. :D
